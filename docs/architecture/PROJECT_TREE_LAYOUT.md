# Project Tree Layout

The repository is normalized around a Tigrbl-native, certification-native package tree.

```text
docs/{adr,architecture,standards,compliance,runbooks}
compliance/{targets,mappings,claims,evidence,gates,waivers}
specs/{openapi,openrpc,jsonschema}
scripts/
tests/{unit,integration,conformance,interop,negative,security,e2e,perf,examples}
tigrbl_auth/{plugin,gateway,api,tables,ops,services,standards,security,config,adapters,schemas,migrations,cli}
```

Legacy paths remain in the repository only as `legacy_transition` artifacts until they are fully replaced.
